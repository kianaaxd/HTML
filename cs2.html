            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>It is a sequel to the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It was revealed on March 22, 2023, and it was
                launched on September 27, 2023, taking the place of Global Offensive on Steam. </p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The majority of the gameplay of CS2 is still quite similar to that of its predecessor, CS:GO, if not
                identical. However, the game has undergone a few small to major adjustments in order to make the
                most of the
                Source 2 Engine.</p>

            <h2>Game Modes</h2>
            <p>There are several multiplayer game types in Counter-Strike 2.

                Classic Competitive and Classic Casual: Traditional game modes for hostage rescue and bomb defusal.
                To
                better accommodate casual and competitive players, the regulations for each are different: casual
                and
                competitive.
                Bomb Scenario: The Counter-Terrorists must guard the bombsite while the Terrorists must place C4
                there.
                Wingman: two vs two games on compact bomb defusal terrain.
                Premier Competitive: A variant of Competitive in which participants use a veto mechanism to choose
                which
                Active Duty maps to play.</p>
        </article>

    <section id="Maps">
        <article>
            <h2>Maps</h2>
            <p>While the game has several maps, the ones that are currently in use are Mirage, Nuke, Overpass,
                Vertigo,
                Ancient, Inferno, and Anubis.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mirage - The Bomb Defusal map Mirage (de_mirage), originally called Strike, is available for
                    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Counter-Strike 2. June 6, 2013, saw the addition of the map
                    to
                    the
                    game. The map is themed like a Middle Eastern town, but because of its close resemblance to
                    Moroccan
                    style architecture, it is likely set somewhere in Morocco.</li>
                <br>

                <li>Nuke - The map takes place in a warehouse containing nuclear materials or a nuclear power plant.
                    In
                    Global Offensive, the original version of the map takes place a German nuclear power plant,
                    while
                    the
                    revamped version takes place in an American one.

                    Unlike most Counter-Strike bomb defusal maps, the map revolves around a central structure rather
                    than
                    multiple lanes, with the two bombsites being overlapped on top of each other.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Overpass - The map's setting is a canal bridge with a park erected above it in Berlin, Germany.
                    The
                    GSG-9 must guard a stopped military shipment on a canal overpass, while the Phoenix Connexion
                    can
                    either
                    attack the container directly or attempt to demolish the flyover by bombing the pillar beneath.

                    Counter-Terrorists spawn at bombsite A, where the crippled freight vehicle is parked. Meanwhile,
                    the
                    Terrorist Spawn Zone is located at the canal's bottom.

                    Bombsite B is located below the CT Spawn Zone and is easily accessible via a stairway. Snipers
                    can
                    readily guard this area since a sniper nest is strategically placed throughout the location.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Vertigo - Vertigo is set in a building that is currently under construction and centers on the
                    battle
                    between the Counter-Terrorist and Terrorist squads. The Terrorists' main goal is to bomb the
                    building,
                    and the CTs must stop them. The bombsites and Counter-Terrorist spawn are both on the top level
                    of
                    the
                    map, whereas the Terrorist spawn is on the lower floor near the staircase.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Ancient - Ancient looks to take place in an archeological site in the middle of a jungle (most
                    likely in
                    Central America). Across the globe, there exist numerous artifacts such as pottery, artworks,
                    and
                    structures that mimic those of the Aztec empire. Each bombsite is referred to as a 'plaza' on
                    the
                    placard and has a separate theme color. Bombsite A is orange with tarps, paint, and signage,
                    whereas
                    Bombsite B is pastel blue.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Inferno - The map depicts a tiny village with European architecture. The existence of the
                    Separatist
                    group in the Global Offensive edition implies that the map is located in Italy, as indicated by
                    the
                    Italian-language signage spotted across the area. However, the separatist party is also present
                    in
                    Spain's Basque territory and in France, so it is possible that it will be present there as well.

                    The map is generally rectangular, with the Counter-Terrorists spawning in one corner, the
                    Terrorists
                    in
                    the diagonally opposite corner, and the two bombsites in the remaining two corners.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Anubis - Anubis (de_anubis) is a Bomb Defusal map made by Roald, jakuza, and jd40 that appears
                    in
                    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It was introduced to the game on March 31, 2020, with
                    Chlorine.
                    Anubis
                    was initially released in Scrimmage mode alone, but it later made its way into the Active Duty
                    Group,
                    replacing Dust II. Anubis was promoted from Scrimmage to Competitive on April 10, 2020, after
                    just
                    ten
                    days in the game. It was the second map to be switched to Competitive since the introduction of
                    Scrimmage, the first being the new Cache. Anubis was deleted from the game on May 3, 2021, but
                    was
                    re-added on August 16, 2022, to commemorate Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's tenth
                    anniversary.

                    Following the IEM Rio 2022 Major, it was added to the Active Duty Group in the November 18, 2022
                    update.
                    This is the second community-created map to make it into the Active Duty Group, following Cache.
